Not too sure where exactly they are based but there's a Canadian retail portal; Prices are in CAD$ and customs/duty charges are already worked in. Haven't bought anything robotics-related from them yet but I have purchased Flexinol wires from them -- and they may be the only place in CAD$ that you can find them.
