Carries almost all of the major electronics components in very neat organized baggies on the wall or bins in the back. This is one of the few places you'll be able to pick up an Arduino or Arduino-related hardware in Toronto. Carries a small collection of the kits you might find at Sparkfun or the Makezine store (listed as online retailers below) so Creatron is definitely worth checking out if you don't want to wait for shipping, plus the prices are comparable.

*Note: As of mid-2014, Creatron moved to 349 College St (at Augusta Ave) from previous location at 255 College St (at Spadina Ave).*
