Closest retailer of Amaco's "Friendly Plastic" (polymorph plastic) -- they are actually in the same building! If you have a GST account, call them directly and they can offer a 30% discount. (U.S. based so be careful of customs; and if you want next day or 3 day shipping, be prepared to pay $80, otherwise only $15 for regular 5-7 day standard shipping.)
