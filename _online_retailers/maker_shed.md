A few years ago, the web store companion to the iconic Make magazine only really carried kits but today is a formidable place for getting Arduinos, Arduino accessories, and general electronics supplies. They even carry more one-off items such as Chumby Guts, Shapelock moldable plastic, and Pixel Qi screens.
