Carries almost all of the major electronics components in very neat organized baggies on the wall or bins in the back. This is one of the few places you'll be able to pick up an Arduino or Arduino-related hardware in Toronto. Carries a small collection of the kits you might find at Sparkfun or the Makezine store (listed as online retailers below) so Creatron is definitely worth checking out if you don't want to wait for shipping, plus the prices are comparable.

*Note: As of mid-2014, Creatron opened a new store at Vic Park and Sheppard and moved their original downtown store to 349 College St (at Augusta Ave) from previous location at 255 College St (at Spadina Ave).*

*Note: The new downtown location is smaller so doesn't stock everything that Creatron sells. They will bring items down from their better stocked suburban store - just give them a call to ask.*
