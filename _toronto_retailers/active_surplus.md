~~Carries major electronics components plus cheap, quirky surplus items. Everything sold "as is" so it may be hard to find the exact item you're looking for since they don't offer datasheets or specs. 20-30% of inventory turns over often so wander its aisles every month or so.~~

Active Surplus closed Sept 2015. Thank you for being a Toronto staple for 35 years.
