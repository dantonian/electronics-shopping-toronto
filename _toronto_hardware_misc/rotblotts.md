This is a go-to destination if you work in the film industry. They have a random assortment of hardware and office supplies, along with surplus items. But my favourite thing is something called "Gaffers tape" which is a slightly more expensive tape than duct tape, but it doesn't leave any sticky residue behind when removed.
